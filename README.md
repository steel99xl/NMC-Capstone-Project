# NMC-Capstone-Project
CIT 110 Capstone Project



The Capstone_Project.exe needs to be run twice, onece to send messages and the second to recive, this could be fixed in a GUI but i cant draw multiple console windows that work with eachother to for the seperate threads

The Capstone_Project.exe it set to point to steel99xl.ddns.net on PORT 80

the Python folder stuff is to run a test server and a test GUI that is writen in python,
this is mainly used to test additional functionality befor it it pushed to the server or the client app
